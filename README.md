# leastsquares
Simple example of counting approximation by least squares using JavaFX<br/><br/>
Branches:
  - master contains original application
  - diffequationssrc contains source files of the application, which solves diff equation which looks like dy/dx = f(x,y) and shows rezult of solving Koshi task for the required point with required accuracy as a graph
  - diffequations contains necessary files for the diffequation application to make it compatible with IntelligIDEA
  - antmode contains latest version of the diffequations application, which runs using ant buildfile
